-  Hi, I’m @chris-begell
-  I’m interested in programming in Python, currently, mainly applications based, but sometimes embedded(I've done one project in Micropython).
-  I’m currently learning SQL.
-  I'm not quite ready to collab on anything, I'm pretty new, and I think I would be a drag.
-  I currently work as a CNC Machinist, and I was in the glass industry for about 20 years before that. I started learning Python about a year ago, currently working on my second project.
-  You can reach me at begellct@gmail.com
