-  Hi, I’m @chris-begell
-  Python programmer, also know some SQL(PostgreSQL), and have owned two Wordpress blogs.
-  I’m currently learning C.
-  I currently work as a CNC Machinist, and I was in the glass industry for about 20 years before that. I started learning Python in 22/23, I'm currently finishing up my third project(an MP3 player, because the world needs more of those).
-  You can reach me at begellct@gmail.com
