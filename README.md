-  Hi, I’m @chris-begell
-  I’m interested in programming in Python, currently, mainly applications based, but sometimes embedded(I've done one project in Micropython).
-  I’m currently learning SQL.
-  I currently work as a CNC Machinist, and I was in the glass industry for about 20 years before that. I started learning Python about a year ago, I just completed my second project.
